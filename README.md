Starota is a Discord bot designed for use on Pokemon Go oriented servers.

If you want to add Starota to your own server, you can invite it from here [this](https://discordbots.org/bot/489245655710040099).  If you want to join the support server, you can join [here](https://discord.gg/NxverNw).  If you are interested in just the Pokedex functionality, you are in luck, I made another bot with just that feature and nothing else and you can invite it from [here](https://discordbots.org/bot/541079916234407967).

Features:
  - Player profiles (featuring level, team, trainer code, real name, link to Silph Road card, and alternate accounts)
  - Basic role management (mark roles as "self-assignable", users can add and remove said roles at any point)
  - Tradeboard (post Pokemon you are looking for/are looking to trade away)
  - Leaderboards (server owners can make unique leaderboards to track anything)
  - Pokedex lookup (using Pokemon Go Hub)
  - PvP coordination commands (mark yourself as "battle-ready")
  - Command to help coordinate and plan raids
  - Show ongoing and upcoming events
  - Raid coordination commands (including raid trains)
  - Pokemon & event search functionality
  - Command to display current Ditto disguises
  - Command to show all current egg hatches
  - Custom Lua scripting for unique features (Patrons only)
  - WIP web-sided interface (Patrons only)
  - Predict in-game weather
  - Catcher's Cup (mini-game type thing, pretty much Harry Potter's house cup, but for PoGo teams)
  - Show latest Silph Arena Cup counters from Pokebattler
